## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learnt how to use the filter property and how relative units affect conatiners

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  filter: drop-shadow(10px 10px black);
}
```

### Continued development

Transitions
Achieving responsiveness with relative units

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me to differentiate between relative units and the advantages of using them. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geekforgeeks.com) - This is an amazing article which also helped me understand the units used in css. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
